The driver also helps deliver it upstairs and puts it in the designated location!\nBecause of the June event, we ordered the Hailu Jiugongge lunch box this time. As soon as I opened it, I felt it was very textured, the dishes were rich and healthy, highly recommended! This is the first time I look forward to a meeting～～",
